    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, I'm not a fan of cheese and try to avoid it whenever possible. So dishes that are stuffed with
        things like ricotta turn me off.
        I created this dish as a compromise to my cheese avoidance and my husband's love of Italian food.
        Serve this with garlic bread and a salad for a wonderful family dinner.</p><br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package jumbo pasta shells</li>

        <li>3 teaspoons vegetable oil, divided</li>

        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>

        <li>1 (16 ounce) package finely shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning, plus more for garnish if desired</li>

        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar prepared marinara sauce</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Lightly oil a 9x13 baking dish.</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook shells in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
            until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain.
            Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet; place drained pasta on baking sheet to cool.</li>

        <li>Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a heavy skillet. Cook and crumble sausage until it
            has lost its pink color and begins to brown.
            Remove from heat; drain off grease. Stir 1/2 of the shredded cheese and Italian seasoning into browned
            sausage.</li>

        <li>Spoon sausage mixture into pasta shells (1 to 2 tablespoons per shell). Arrange stuffed shells in the
            prepared baking dish.</li>

        <li>Pour marinara sauce evenly over the shells. Top with remaining shredded cheese. Cover tightly with aluminum
            foil.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
            Remove foil; bake until browned, 5 to 10 more minutes. Sprinkle with a pinch of Italian seasoning, if
            desired.</li>
    </ol>
